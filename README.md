# Summary

This is a project aimed to provide open access to a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation. The model was implemented in both the R and Julia programming languages.

**Goal of this work**: to develop a versatile platform model for HSC differentiation to erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. The model was shown to be able to predict the dynamics of cell reconstitution after ex-vivo gene therapy.


**Motivation of this work**: there had been many partial models developed for HSC differentiation into subset of cells, or development of HSC-derived cells (e.g. T cell development in thymus). However, these models failed to capture the complexity and the multi-organ nature of HSC differentiation. Our work aimed to fill this gap. The result was an integrated multi-organ QSP model that captures HSC differentiation to red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, T cells, and B cells and their dynamics in blood and in other tissues.


**Method**: the model was built in a stepwise fashion by integrating published models while incorporating multiple layers of progenitors described in the literature. It was calibrated based on experimental data obtained in mice and humans. 

**Results**: We demonstrated that the model could capture

1. RBCs, T cell, and B cell reconstitution in mice after HSC transplant;

2. the vector copy number (VCN) dynamics on ADA-SCID mice after receiving ex-vivo gene therapy;

3. granulocytes’ and lymphocytes’ reconstitution after ex-vivo gene therapy in a patient who suffered from adenosine deaminase‐deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID);

4. RBC and hemoglobin reconstitution after ex-vivo gene therapy in a patient with sickle cell disease (SCD).

**Future work**: we believed our model could be adapted to predict the outcome of different gene therapy protocols for the following diseases:

- Transfusion-dependent <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\beta" title=" " />-thalassemia (approved in the U.S. under the name [ZYNTEGLO](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-announces-fda-approval-zynteglor-first-gene-therapy))
- Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD) ([NCT04105166](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04105166))
- Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) (authorized in Europe under the name [Libmeldy](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/libmeldy))

We believed our model could benefit from additional calibration/ validation with additional data at progenitor level. Details were discussed in the [future work](#future-work) and [Challenges and uncertainties](#challenges) sections.

## Model development

This model integrated 4 published models: 

- A model of human HSC differentiation into red blood cells (RBCs) ([Zheng et al., 2021](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12638)).

- A mouse B cell development model ([Shahaf et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00077/full)).

- A mouse T cell development model ([Thomas-Vaslin et al., 2008](https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/180/4/2240/84513/Comprehensive-Assessment-and-Mathematical-Modeling)).

- A human naive T cell dynamics model ([Sove et al., 2020](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12546))

<img src="img/Diagram_integration.png" alt="model structure" width="500" >

The model was developed in 4 steps: 

1. Implement an existing human HSC -> RBC differentiation model ([Zheng et al., 2021](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12638)). <a id='human-scd'></a>

2. Scale the HSC -> RBC differentiation model from human to mouse based on literature data. <a id='mouse-scd'></a>

3. Integrate a T cells development model from [Thomas-Vaslin et al., 2008](https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/180/4/2240/84513/Comprehensive-Assessment-and-Mathematical-Modeling), a B cells development model from [Shahaf et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00077/full), and HSC -> granulocyte differentiation model into the mouse HSC -> RBC differentiation model in mouse. <a id='mouse-integrated'></a>

4. Scale the integrated mouse HSC differentiation model to human. <a id='human-integrated'></a>

Simulations demonstrated our model was able to predict the immune cell reconstitution of a patient with ADA-SCID after receiving ex-vivo gene therapy ([Aiuti et al., 2009](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0805817)). 

In addition, our model was validated using the RBC recovery after ex vivo gene therapy in a patient ([Ribeil et al., 2017](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1609677)), ex vivo gene therapy in mouse ([Carbonaro et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22833548/)), and stem cell/ progenitor transplants in mouse ([Boyer et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30905737/)).

All models in this folder were implemented in R and solved using `mrgsolve`. See [Setup](#r-setup-section) for more information. 


# Implementation <a id='human-scd-implementation'></a> and validation of red blood cell differentiation in human 

This model was described in [Zheng et al., 2021](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12638). Here we document our implementation of the model and adjustments we made. 


## Model implementation

Compare to the model described in [Zheng et al., 2021](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12638), we have some major changes.

1. Globin synthesis and assembly implementation. This adjustment was to match the unit in both side of the differential equation and match the fluxes in the system. Here we use <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\beta" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta" title="\beta" /></a>-globin synthesis in RET as an example. 

    In Zheng et al., 2021, the dynamics was written as 
    
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{d}{dt}&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;=&space;k_{syn\beta}&space;\cdot&space;RET_0&space;-&space;(k_{deg\beta}&space;&plus;&space;k_{RET2RBC})&space;\cdot&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;-&space;k_{on\alpha\beta}&space;\cdot&space;\alpha_{RET0}&space;\cdot&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;/V_{RET0}&space;&plus;&space;k_{off\alpha\beta}&space;\cdot&space;\alpha\beta_{RET0}" title=""  width="600" />

    
    In this equation, the 
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k_{syn\beta}&space;\cdot&space;RET_0&space;" title="k_{syn\beta} \cdot RET_0 " /> represented mass change over time, but 
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k_{on\alpha\beta}&space;\cdot&space;\alpha_{RET0}&space;\cdot&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;/V_{RET0}&space;" title="" /> 
    was concentration changes over time. 

    To correct this mismatch, we changed the equation into 

    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{d}{dt}&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;=&space;k_{syn\beta}&space;\cdot&space;RET_0&space;-&space;(k_{deg\beta}&space;&plus;&space;k_{RET2RBC})&space;\cdot&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;-&space;k_{on\alpha\beta}&space;\cdot&space;\alpha_{RET0}&space;\cdot&space;\beta_{RET0}&space;&plus;&space;k_{off\alpha\beta}&space;\cdot&space;\alpha\beta_{RET0}&space;\times&space;V_{RET0}" title="\frac{d}{dt} \beta_{RET0} = k_{syn\beta} \cdot RET_0 - (k_{deg\beta} + k_{RET2RBC}) \cdot \beta_{RET0} - k_{on\alpha\beta} \cdot \alpha_{RET0} \cdot \beta_{RET0} + k_{off\alpha\beta} \cdot \alpha\beta_{RET0} \times V_{RET0}" /> 

    Similar changes were carried out in all the globin differential equations. 


2. Long-term haematopoietic stem cell proliferation rate. This rate was not provided in Zheng et al., 2021. The parameter used here was obtained from [Catlin et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099568/) (0.057 day<sup>-1</sup>).  

3. Alpha globin synthesis rate. This rate was decreased from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1.5&space;\times&space;10^{-6}" title="1.5 \times 10^{-6}" /> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?6&space;\times&space;10^{-7}" title="6 \times 10^{-7}" /> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>. 

    We tuned this parameter because the simulation result based on parameters reported in Zheng et al., 2021 did not fit normal human physiology. Simulated red blood cell in a normal person was ~12 trillion, half of what it was supposed to be, yet hemoglobin concentration inside red blood cell was more than twice of the normal value. 

    To tune this parameter, we used 3 metrics reported in [Pittman, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21634070/): 
        
        i.   RBC count. In healthy human, it should be ~ 4 million per uL.

        ii.  Hemoglobin concentration in blood. In healthy human, it should be 12 ~ 15.5g/dL. 

        iii. Hemoglobin concentration in RBC. This value should be ~ 330g/L. 

    ![alpha globin synthesis rate tuning](img/scd_ksynalpha.png)

    Overall, when the globin synthesis rate equaled <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?6&space;\times&space;10^{-7}" title="6 \times 10^{-7}" /> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>, most of the observed metrics fell into the normal range. Thus, in our future implementation, we used the tuned value. 

    In addition, this change was overall in line with observed hemoglobin synthesis rate.
    In [Hibbert et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457298/), the hemoglobin synthesis rate in rat was described as ~ 0.11-0.42mg.g<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming human had the same synthesis rate, a body of 70kg, and 240 billions of reticulocytes (number estimated based on [Koepke and Koepke, 1986](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2257.1986.tb00093.x) that number of reticulocyte is 1/100 of number of red blood cells), then human's supposed to have a hemoglobin synthesis rate between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?5.9&space;\times&space;10^{-7}" title="5.9 \times 10^{-7}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?2.2&space;\times&space;10^{-6}" title="2.2 \times 10^{-6}" /> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>. By the assumption that synthesis rates between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\alpha, &space;\beta, &space; \gamma, &space; \delta" title=" " /> globins were 1: 0.5: 0.03: 0.04, then the synthesis rate for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\alpha" title=" " />-globin should be in the range of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?3.8&space;\times&space;10^{-7}" title="3.8 \times 10^{-7}" /> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1.4&space;\times&space;10^{-6}" title="1.4 \times 10^{-6}" /> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>.
    
    Moreover, in SCD patients, it was reported that Hb synthesis rate averages 0.2g.kg<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup> ([Hibbert et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084935/)). This converted to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\alpha" title=" " />-globin synthesis rate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?6.8&space;\times&space;10^{-7}"> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>, close to the value we identitified. 
    
    ## Model validation

    We validated our implementation in 2 different scenarios: 
    
    1. Steady state

       A summary table of steady state value was as follows. These values were overall in line with what is observed in human ([Hibbert et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084935/)).

        |                | RBC (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\times&space;10^{6}">/uL) | RBC Reference number ([Hibbert et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084935/)) (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\times&space;10^{6}">/uL) | Hb (g/dL) | Hb Reference number ([Hibbert et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084935/)) | venous oxygen (mL/dL) | 
        | -----------    | -------| ------- |----------| ---      | --------------------- | 
        | Healthy person | 4.2    | 4.0-4.7 |12.3 (HbA)      | 11.2-13.7 (HbA)| 13.2                 | 
        | SCD patients   | 1.8    | 0.2-1.4 |6.8 (HbS)       | 6.6-11.1 (HbS)| 6.6                  | 


    2. Dynamics of Hb normalization after HSC transplantation in a SCD patient ([Ribeil et al., 2017](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1609677)). In this case, we compared 4 simulated variables with observed data after the transplant: 
    
    - Total RBC count
    - Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, both HbS and HbA with T87Q mutation (the transgene carried by lentivirus). 
    - reticulocytes (RET) count
    - Hb concentration in RBC

    The simulation results as well as clinical observation were shown as follows. Overall, the steady states of simulation and patients were similar, though the RBC and Hb recovery dynamics is a little off. This might be due to infusion this patient received prior to receiving ex-vivo gene therapy. These infused RBCs/ Hb were present for at least 3 months after gene therapy, judging by HbA level in patient blood. 
    
    Note that the predicted total RET count (cyan line, top right panel) corresponded well to the observed data. This indicated the model probably worked well upstream of RET.

# Scale the HSC -> RBC differentiation model from human to mouse

The goal of this step was to obtain a HSC -> RBC differentiation model in mouse, so that we could eventually incorporate granulocytes and lymphocyte dynamics based on published model. We'd like to have a model in mouse because there were more literature data related to HSC differentiation in mouse. 

The graphic summary of the model was as follows. Here, we assumed the feedback impact on CFU-E dynamics and Hb saturation level in mouse were comparable to human.

  alt="the model diagram for HSC->RBC differentiation in mouse"
  align="center">
</figure>


This model was based on the following adjustments:

1.  Adjustments on cells' mean residence time

    - Red blood cell (RBC) lifespan. It was reduced from 120 days to 40 days ([Putten and Croon, 1958](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/13/8/789/33568/The-Life-Span-of-Red-Cells-in-the-Rat-and-the)).

    - Reticulocyte (RET) maturation time. It was decreased to 2 days from 3 days ([Ney, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3157046/)). 

    - Colony-forming unit erythroid (CFU-E) cell residence time. It was reduced to 2 days from 7 days ([Palis, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24478716/#:~:text=Definitive%20RBCs%20in%20mammals%20circulate,nucleated%20cells%20before%20ultimately%20enucleating.)). 


2. Adjustments on cell amplification/ division time

    - Short-term hematooietic stem cells (ST-HSC) and multipotent progenitors (MPP) amplification times. They were adjusted to 32 and 280 times ([Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242)).

    - Burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) cell amplification time. It was reduced to 16 times ([Palis, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904103/)).

    - Common myeloid progenitors (CMP) number of division. The amplification was decreased to 8. It was estimated based on the flux from in and out of CMP. 

        - Influx. This is from MPP. Amongst all the efflux from MPP, the ratio between CMP : common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) is 1:180 ([Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242)), thus we could assume ~ 114k of MPP goes to CMP per day.  
    
        - Efflux. This was based on the estimation from RBC dynamics. 
        
        Assuming mouse RBC lifespan = 40 days, RBC count = 10M per uL, with 2mL blood, then the total RBC count in mouse = 10M * 2k = 20B. For each day, the RBC death was 20B/ 40 = 500M. Assuming 32 times amplification at CFU-E stage and 16 times of amplification at BFU-E stage, we calculated that CMP efflux to BFU-E ~800k. 

        With influx:efflux ratio ~ 8, we estimated that CMP underwent 3 times of division (i.e. amplification = 8). 

3. Other modifications

    - All transduced branches were consolidated. This simplification was purely technical and had no scientific impact on the model. 

    - Volumes of RET and RBC.  The scaled down volume of RET/ RBC was 0.05 * 10<sup>-12</sup> L. This number was calculated based on RBC diameter data reported in [Fukuda et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658564/). This number was also in line with what is reported in [Raabe et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189672/) and [Bollinger and Everds, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820082000143). 


    - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\alpha" title="" />-globin synthesis rate was reduced to  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?3.8&space;\times&space;10^{-7}" title="" /> nmol.cell<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>. This adjustment was made due to mice were reported to have more RBCs. 

## Model validation

Here we used both steady state values and RBC recovery dynamics after stem cell and progenitor transplant to validate our model. 

Simulated steady state values and their corresponding physiological values in mouse were summarized as follows. Note that all data from [Bae et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11386-4) were adjusted to account for the fact that its BM cells were isolated from tibia and femur, bones that accounted for ~14% of total bone marrow cells ([Colvin et al., 2004](https://www.nature.com/articles/2403268)). We assumed that total bone marrow cell count ~ 500M, and bone marrow cells from tibia and femur was ~60-80M ([Swamydas et  al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3732092/)). 

| State Variable           |    Predicted value  | Reference value |
| -----------     |   --------- |  -----------  |
| RET count  (#/uL) | 479k      | 200 - 500k  ([Bollinger and Everds, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820082000143)) |
| RBC count  (#/ul) |  9.5M      | 10.2M ([Fukuda et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658564/)) |
| Hb conc (g/dL)   |   13.1     | 13.6 - 16.4 ([Raabe et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189672/)) |
| Hb in RBC  (g/L)  |   274     | 270 - 330  ([Bollinger and Everds, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820082000143)) |
| MPP               |    15k     |  75k-92k ([Bae et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11386-4), [Dong et al., 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/9/951/htm))  |
| CMP               |   913k   |  755k- 3M ([Bae et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11386-4), [Dong et al., 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/9/951/htm), [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242))  |
| CFU-E amplification time |    32.8 | 16-32 ([Palis, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904103/)) |   

The discrepancy between predicted and observed MPP values could be attributed to the fact that the current model only considered MPP that were part of the erythroid lineage, which represented ~20% of total MPP. ([Pietras et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193459091500212X), [Wilson et al., 2008](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(08)01386-X.pdf)). 


We then compared the dynamics of cell reconstitution after stem/ progenitor cells transplants in mouse. Data was obtained from [Boyer et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30905737/). Briefly, these mice went through sublethal radiation conditioning before being transplanted with a fixed number of GFP-expressing stem cells/ progenitor. 

Here, we assumed the sublethal irradiation leads to 10% - 50% loss of progenitor cells in bone marrow. 

![](img/mouse_RBC_HSCT_MPPT.png)

We noticed the steady state of HSC transplant was overall similar to reported data, though the dynamics is slower. This might be due to HSC proliferating faster after a reduction in their number [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242). The dynamics after MPP transplantation tracked observed data well. 

# Incorporate granulocytes and lymphocytes into the mouse HSC differentiation model 

The main reason for including lymphoid dynamics is to be able to use this model for gene therapy in people with immune deficiencies. Granulocytes were included as placeholder so that the MPP count would match observed data. Thus, we took very different approaches between myeloid and lymphoid branches: we built a coarse granulocyte differentiation model follow the differentiation map MPP -> CMP -> GMP -> granulocytes (GM), while developing a more physiologically-based lymphoid branch. 

The schema of the mouse model was provided as follows.

![](img/mouse_full_model.png)


## Incorporate GMP and granulocytes

Here, we only considered 2 layers: granulocytes (GM) and granulocyte progenitor cells (GMP) ([Ferrari et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-00298-5)). 

Parameter values and adjustments were as follows.

- Differentiation rate from CMP to GMP. This value was set to be 2.5 day<sup>-1</sup>., in the range of 0.04-4 day<sup>-1</sup> reported in [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242). 

- Mean residence time of GMP. This was set to be 0.12 day ([Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242)). 

- Turnover of granulocytes. This value was set to be 3 day<sup>-1</sup>. It was based on GM lifespan of 6-8 hours in mouse, monkey, and human ([Summers et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620114/), [He et al., 2018](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/200/12/4059), [Galbraith et al., 1965](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/25/5/683/37897/Patterns-of-Granulocyte-Kinetics-in-Health)). This translated to death rate ~ 3-4 day<sup>-1</sup>. 

- Amplification at ST-HSC and MPP. MPP amplification round was increased from 280 to 450, the upper bound reported in [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242). ST-HSC amplification number was increased to 90. This number was 1.5 times higher than the number reported in [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242). However, this might be due to [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242) and [Zheng et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34139105/) uses different numbers of LT-HSC for parameter estimation.

- Amplification from GMP to GM. This parameter assumed to be 32 because there were 4 additional layers of mitotic progenitors between GMP and neutrophil, the most abundant granulocytes ([Hong, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662779/)). Assuming each layer of mitotic progenitors came with additional round of cell division, the amplification between GMP & GM would be 2<sup>5</sup> = 32.

- Granulocyte count in mouse blood. This number was reported to ~ 6k/uL ([Nemzek et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11713907/)).Assuming mouse blood volume ~ 2mL, the total number of GM in mouse would be ~ 12 millions. Note that this number may vary hugely between different mice ([von Vietinghoff and Ley, 2008](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/181/8/5183)). 

## Incorporate lymphoid arms

The B cell and T cell development models were taken from literature. We incorporated common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) described in [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242) to link these literature models with our model.


### Incorporate common lymphoid progenitors

To incorporate common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), a progenitor cell that was derived from multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells, we took parameters of differentiation rate, proliferation rate, and death rate from [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242). 

### Incorporate B cell dynamics

The B cell model was taken from [Shahaf et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00077/full). The schema was as follows. 

![diagram_shahaf2016](img/Diagram_shahaf2016.jpg)

Additional 2 divisions are assumed between CLP and a B cell progenitor, propreB. This number was tuned to match the cell influxes into the propreB compartments that are reported in [Shahaf et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00077/full). 

### Incorporate T cell dynamics

The T cell model was taken from [Thomas-Vaslin et al., 2008](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/180/4/2240.long). The schema was as follows. 

![diagram_thomas2008](img/Diagram_thomas2008.png)

The additional 512 times of amplification between CLP and double negative (DN) cells was estimated based on the assumption that there were a round of division when CLP differentiate into early thymic progenitors (ETP), and ETPs divided additional 8 times in thymus before differentiate into DNs ([Seddon and Yates, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30129206/)). Note that in our model, we omit ETP for simplicity.


The rate for CLP to be exported to thymus was unknown, presumably because this number was very small thus hard to observe in experimental setting. Thus, we tuned this rate to fit with observed data from 2 different source: 
1. the CLP count that exported to thymus should < 10 cells per day ([Zlotoff and Bhandoola, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076003/));
2. naive T cell count should be less than 1700 cells per uL blood at steady state ([Boyer et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30905737/)); 

A parameter scan suggested that this rate should be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?2.5\times 10^{-4}" title=" " />day<sup>-1</sup>.

## Model validation

### Simulated cell counts at state state are within the range reported in the literature

Simulated steady state and their corresponding physiological values were summarized as below. Overall, simulated steady state of the cells was consistent with what is observed in literature. 

| Cell type | Simulated cell count   | Reference cell count | 
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| MPP       |   60k        |  75k-92k ([Bae et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11386-4), [Dong et al., 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/9/951/htm))  |
| CMP       |   2M         | 755k- 3M ([Bae et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11386-4), [Dong et al., 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/9/951/htm), [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242))  |
| GMP       |   757k       | ~1M ([Bae et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11386-4)), ~3M([Dong et al., 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/9/951/htm)) |
| GM        | 8.4k/uL  | 1.95-12.01k/uL ([Nemzek et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11713907/))  |
| RET       | 498k/uL  | 200 - 500k/uL  ([Bollinger and Everds, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820082000143)) |
| RBC       | 9.9M/uL  | 10.2M/uL ([Fukuda et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658564/)) |
| Hb conc   | 13.2g/dL     | 13.6 - 16.4g/dL ([Raabe et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189672/)) |
| Hb in RBC | 261g/L      | 270-330g/L  ([Bollinger and Everds, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820082000143)) |
| lymphocyte | 1.8k/uL     | 0.12 - 24k/uL ([JHU mouse facility](https://researchanimalresources.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017JHPhenoCoreCBCmice.pdf)) |

### Dynamics after HSCT

The model was also validated by looking at the reconsititution dynamics of RBC, B cells, and T cells after HSC transplant in mouse (data obtained from [Busch et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14242)).

![dynamics_validation](img/mouse_RBC_T_B_HSCT.png)

Overall, the RBC reconstitution was slower, as we observed in our previous simulation. The predicted B cell reconstitution was in the standard deviation of the observed data. 
T cell recovery at a 50% conditioning strength (i.e. loss of 50% progenitors) appeared to match the early reconstitution dynamics the best, but a 30% conditioning yielded closer steady state. 

## Adapting mouse model for younger mice

Our eventual goal for the mouse model was to predict the ex-vivo gene therapy for ADA-SCID mice. One challenge was that many experiments were carried out on mice that were 14-18 days after birth to avoid potential systematic complications or death.

However, in these very young mice, their naive T cell dynamics were different. They had higher thymic output, probably due to either a more lymphoid-biased differentation (i.e. higher MPP -> CLP differentiation rate), or faster proliferation in lymphoid progenitors ([Young et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068232/), [Baran-Gale et al., 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56221)). 

Sensitivity analysis showed that the steady state peripheral blood T cell concentration was not sensitive to DN/ DP cell proliferation rates (data not shown). Thus, for simplicity, we tune the MPP -> CLP differentiation rate. We use the CD4+ thymocyte as the benchmark. In prior simulation, this number was ~ 300k. In 15-day mice, it was ~780k ([Lee, 2018](https://theses.gla.ac.uk/31002/)). In addition, splenic B cell count was ~25.2M in these young mice ([Blackburn and Kellems, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15705418/)).

Our parameter scan suggested that increasing MPP -> CLP rate by 2.5-3.5 folds could address the discrepancy in steady state lymphocyte count between a 15-day mouse and 3-month old mice. 

![](img/mouse_15day_ada_scid.png)

By choosing to increase MPP -> CLP differentiation rate by 3 folds, lymphocytes at steady state have higher counts. 

| Mouse | naive T per uL blood |  naive B per uL blood |
| ----- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| young | 5.3k                 | 325                   |
| adult | 1.7k                 | 130                   |


## Adapting mouse model for Adenosine deaminase deficiency Severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) mouse

ADA-SCID is caused by mutations in adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme that is reported to be important for dADP, dATP degradation in cells. Lack of ADA results in dADP, dATP accumulation and toxicity to cells. ADA is universally expressed, but most active in lymphocytes ([Flinn et al., 2018](https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-018-0807-5)).

ADA-SCID manifestation in mice included abnormal thymocyte. Double positive (DP) cells was reported to have higher apoptosis rate ([Whitmore and Gasper, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00314/full)). In addition, the apoptosis and distribution of peripheral T cells appeared to be normal in ADA-SCID mice ([Apasov et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC209335/)). 
 
ADA-SCID also resulted in impairment in B cell development. The most prominent phenotypes were on activated B cells, while mature naive B cells in the spleen was reported to have a higher death rate ([Whitmore and Gasper, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00314/full), [Blackburn and Kellems, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15705418/), [Aldrich et al., 2003](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/171/10/5562.full.pdf), [Prak, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3366416/)).

Thus, for our adaptation, we focused on adjusting DP thymocyte and naive splenic B cell death rates. 

To determine DP thymocyte death rate, we used percentage of DN cells amongst thymocytes as the benchmark. We chose this because this appeared to be the most robust readout, while other benchmarks like absolute progenitor/ lymphocytes counts were highly variable ([Blackburn and Kellems, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15705418/), [Blackburn et al., 1998](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(17)47085-2/pdf), [Blackburn et al., 2000](https://rupress.org/jem/article/192/2/159/30028/Metabolic-Consequences-of-Adenosine-Deaminase), [Morreti et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02572-w)). 

In control mice, DN cell was reported to be less than 5% of total thymocytes; in ADA-SCID mice, this number was ~ 20% ([Morreti et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02572-w)). A parameter scan indicated that that DP death rate should be increased to 2 day<sup>-1</sup>. 

![](img/mouse_dpdeathscan.png)

To determine splenic mature B cell death rate, we looked at splenic B cell count. In ADA-SCID mice, splenic B cell count was reported to be ~ 4M. Parameter scan suggested that splenic mature B cell death rate should be increased from 0.032 day<sup>-1</sup> to 0.15 day<sup>-1</sup>. 

![](img/mouse_BMspl_dscan.png)

Simulation predicted a drop in steady state lymphocyte in peripheral blood in ADA-SCID mouse compared to normal mouse.  

| Mouse    | Predicted lymphocyte in peripheral blood | Reference lymphocyte in peripheral blood ([Blackburn et al., 1998](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(17)47085-2/pdf)) |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Control  | 5.6k/uL    | 3.2k/uL |
| ADA-SCID |   776/uL   | 1k/uL   |



## Simulation of ex-vivo gene therapy in ADA-SCID mice. 

In [Carbonaro et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22833548/), ex-vivo gene therapy was performed in mice that were either in enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or not. We chose to focus on mice on ERT, as study showed that they had almost normal immune system ([Morreti et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02572-w)).  In this study, authors isolated bone marrow cells from donor mice, transduced the cells with an average vector copy (VCN) at 0.99 +/- 0.76 (i.e. on average, each transduced cell carried 0.99 transgene) before infusing 5M cells back to the receiver mice.

The receiver mice were conditioned on 200cGy radiation before receiving the cell infusion. 

### Gene therapy simulation

We assumed the conditioning resulted in 30% loss of all dividing/ differentiating progenitors in the bone marrow, and 80% loss in thymus. Fractions of each progenitor cells in transplanted bone marrow cells was estimated based on steady state bone marrow composition. 

Overall, the simulations at steady state were also consistent with observed data. 

![](img/mouse_adascidgtsimul.png)

# Scale HSC differentiation model from mouse to human

The mouse HSC differentiation model was scaled to human as follows. 

The parts of the model that were originally from human and scaled to mouse were reverted back to their original hman values. These included: erythoid cell amplications and Hb synthesis. We adjusted CMP amplification time from 16 to 36 to compensate cells being diverged to myeloid lineage. 

![](img/human_full_structure.png)

## Scale myeloid lineage from mouse to human

We increased GMP amplification number from 32 to 128 to compensate for more granulocytes death in human. 

## Scale B cell dynamics from mouse to human

Since it was almost impossible to directly measure the rates of B cell development in human, while the cellular processes are fairly comparable between these two species ([Carsetti et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14962195/), [Ghia et al., 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9785673/)), we kept most of the mouse parameters, but one significant adjustment on the capacity of bone marrow hosting B cells. We scaled it to be 8.4B. This was estimated by linear scaling the capacity based on cell count of bone marrow between mouse and human listed as follows: 

- In mouse, the total bone marrow had ~500M cells. 
    
- In human, we estimated the total cellular count ~ 700B. This was based on the cell density (0.4M per uL, reported in [Mulder, 1974](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-abstract/61/2/199/1770391?redirectedFrom=PDF)) and volume (~ 1.75L, [Hassan and El-Sheemy, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1079613/#:~:text=An%20adult%20weighing%2070%20kg,haemorrhage%20it%20can%20increase%20sixfold.)).

- In mouse, the B cell progenitor hosting capacity in bone marrow is 6M. 

Thus, the human bone marrow B cell capacity = 6M/500M * 700B = 8.4B. 

In addition, we increased propreB proliferation rate to account for bigger bone marrow compartment in human.

## Scale T cell dynamics from mouse to human

One of the major difference between mouse and human naive T cell dynamics is their source: in mouse, thymic output is the main source for naive T cell maintenance; in human, naive T cell proliferation in peripheral tissue and blood have a prominant role ([Famili et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5583695/), [Spits, 1994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8011206/)). Thus, we introduced naive T cell proliferation in periphery blood and tissues while kept most of the rates in T cell development in thymus the same [Thomas-Vaslin et al., 2008](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/180/4/2240.short). In addition, we also incorporated naive T cell entering and leaving lymph nodes. 

Model structure was as follows.

<img src="img/human_naiveT.png" alt="model structure" width="500" >

Major adjustments were

  + Separated lymph nodes from other tissues. We allowed naive T cells to enter peripheral tissues and lymph nodes with different rates. 
  + Introduced naive T cell proliferations in peripheral tissues and blood.
  + Introduced naive T cell death in peripheral tissues. 
  + No naive T cell death in lymph nodes.
  + Same type of naive T cells had the same death rates across organs, but CD4+ and CD8+ naive T cells had different death rates. 
  + CD4+ and CD8+ naive T cells had different rates leaving peripheral tissues. 


In addition, amplification number of CLP after exported to thymus is increased a fold to compensate for human size.


All the T cell dynamics rates outside thymus were taken from [Sove et al., 2020](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12546). Note one issue was that this paper didn't provide rates for CD4+ naive T cells, so we mostly used CD8+ naive T cell rates, except the rate for naive CD4+ cells leaving peripheral tissues. This value was tuned to make the CD4+:CD8+ ratio in blood ~ 2 ([Benjamin et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323401395000838)), as showed below.

# Model validation

Simulated steady state values and their corresponding physiological values were listed as follows. Simulated steady state values were close to literature values.

|    | simulated | observed |
|----|-----------|----------|
| RBC count (per uL) | 3.9M | ~4M ([Pittman, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21634070/)) |
| Hb (g/dL) | 13.2 | 12-15 ([Pittman, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21634070/)) |
| Hb in RBC (g/L) | 366 | ~330 ([Pittman, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21634070/)) |
| T cell count (per uL) | 662 | 1243 ([Alamooti et al., 2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.20912), note this number is not naive T cell specific) |
| Thymic output (per day) | 32M | 10M - 2700M ([Bains et al., 2009](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/183/7/4329.long)), note the high thymic output happens in infancy |
| B cell count (per uL) | 137 | 101 ([Perez-Andres et al., 2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.b.20547)) |
|Granulocyte count (per uL) | 1.2k | 1-8k ([Yazdi, 2021](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/granulocytes/#:~:text=infections%20%5B27%5D.-,Granulocytes%20Normal%20Range,microliter%20(%C2%B5L)%20of%20blood.)) |


We use data from [Ribeil et al., 2017](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1609677) for validation as well. Note this is a simulation of dynamics of Hb and erythroid cells after HSC transplantation in a SCD patient. The validation on blood cell/ hemoglobin reconstitution was similar to what we discussed before. 

![](img/human_erythroid_validation.png)


# ADA-SCID model adaption

We use the death rates on DP thymocytes and splenic mature B cells from ADA-SCID mice in this human model. Observed data was obtained from a patient that was not treated with PEG-ADA in [Sauer et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3366410/).

|                    | simulated | observed |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|
| blood T cells (uL) | 149       | 138      |
| blood B cells (uL) | 61        | 0        |

The simulated blood T cell was close to observed number in [Sauer et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3366410/).

# Ex-vivo gene therapy for ADA-SCID patient <a id='ada-scid-infant'></a>

Data was obtained from [Aiuti et al., 2009](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0805817). we focused on patient #1 because it was the only patient without prior treatment or adverse events during treatment.

We assumed this patient's body weight to be ~7.6kg, based on the patient's gender and age (as a seven-month old female). This translated into a total ~65M of infused CD34+ cells. 

The simulation recaptured the reconstitution of granulocytes, B cells and T cells in patient's peripheral blood. 

![](img/human_ada_scid_GT.png)

# Challenges and uncertainties <a id='challenges'></a>

Data availability has been the biggest challenge for model development. This was especially true for progenitor cells between stem cells and fully differentiated ones (e.g. RBC, B cells). In addition, many rates for cell differentiation and proliferation were not reported. Thus, we largely relied on steady state and parameter tuning to provide educated guesses for unreported rates. Here, we list all the parameters that were not directly taken from literature.

- mouse

  + the rate for common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) being exported to thymus
  + division between CLP and B cell and T cell progenitors in bone marrow and in thymus, respectively
  + radioactive-conditioning strength on different cell population
  + breakdown of the transplanted stem cell/ progenitors 
  + difference between young mouse and adult mouse (MPP -> CLP)
  + DP cell (T cell progenitor) and splenic B cell death rate in ADA-SCID mouse 

- human

  + the amplification time of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP)
  + B cell capacity in bone marrow
  + rate for CD4+ T cell exit peripheral tissues


In addition, there are questions about the suitability of using this model for pediatric population. In our [simulation](#ada-scid-infant), we showed that our model was able to predict immune cell reconstitution on a 7-month old. We were surprised by this, since the HSC proliferation was built on the hypothesis that adult bone marrow can only carry certain amount of stem cells. It is not clear how applicable this hypothesis is in pediatric population. 


# Future work <a id='future-work'></a>

1. Adapting the model to predict ex-vivo gene therapy outcome in transfusion-dependent <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\beta" title=" " />-thalassemia. This can be achieved by modulating hemoglobin beta chain synthesis and RBC lifespan in the existing model. 

2. Adapting the model to predict ex-vivo gene therapy outcome on pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD). This would require the following adjustment in the model: 

    i. Introduce RET death. 
    
    ii. Decrease RET mean residence time

    iii. Decrease RBC lifespan. 


3. Incorporating additional cell types (e.g. NK cells, platelet) or refine current model (e.g. on granulocyte development). This will allow modelders to utilize information that are commonly mentioned in clinical studies, such as neutrophil engraftment, pletelet engraftment, and VCN in PBMC.

4. Prediction on the minimal effective dose/ conditioning strength for ex-vivo gene therapy that can cross-correct (i.e. an enzyme can be secreted by a genetic-corrected cell and then being utilized by another diseased cell to correct its phenotype; digram shown below). This may be especially relevant when the the ex-vivo gene therapy for lysosomal storage diseases, as lysosomal enzymes are secreted and reuptaken through the same pathway ([Dahms et al., 1989](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/778417/1-s2.0-S0021925818X60724/1-s2.0-S0021925818638256/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjELz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIBlIdRYr%2B9slXPOpOuWrYhvnWUeH2%2Bl4Ll0%2Ff6uED8u0AiEA9BZa1rj2%2FM5whzjyK3rJrqiK7hMoK7FAzGATlnD1sfQqzAQIVBAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDOQU73DXLv%2FPCLnWtyqpBDFJ3clcNqlJa26XbTQgevZnO26bX25kQhV0yFsS5ozAbMWaE%2F4v%2BxIqKrfjItCxjiucf4nw7Shgud60YtnXzj6fA6auII0hAmmHfZ4tlhzOy64rDFHWLW6QPXzlWuEZfP5PnHAVXL2VnnK%2Fxk8HSBwbJCsgdOpV8xh5%2FR92wajInOu6pdETAFnrlbntq%2B98HAyCW5o4wkgBhC2R%2Favu8HB7Onp5%2B0i2CT9Voz36JOSOYTJ14oLz6XhmFhtExk3NFBDEcttqagC7NvIBga4UB9V80TiQ0HOlcI7fCT%2FAFzgf%2BcHDHioLnlL3kIeR9nJnhcGaquIiJBYAc1LXjN1LkydpQiTWyIkApPfTutXiBCHcSw6f%2FoHDm7zBKjilGRDDJEQ%2BGE6wKJ5aQ4%2B2S%2BVzK9UzOCt86Li2m1z9CgakjEucegMRZA7%2BQxKMFZa1mQblnmMklI%2FDJ5lXoueTRtj%2BJkowufze2MLf4QFnMUV7JejftI95otFpjjW7uIJ3XPcqHoK3qfyvWqRy4ULaWvL2yQI2BOWJnEV3ymdkLE4OIvYPN0vO5bB%2FlGZ2RA77gF%2FPKrfemjYFxSJ9tzolgWqSy2tvrQXvhZrvuqo7E27t%2FKVdvYK9OJ9v9fCFxEomiZ2Td3Z8nMhB3pWkapp0ufdLiluitM0G2v5nm1qytdACfF3X0pAdff4YQn2AMSa5iN%2BK3xb%2Fii6ZbIs%2FxFpoQUe7yC3NALWKuIqBC%2BUwkuW7nwY6qQFvUSFfuZ5IhP9ZwpPb7mlgz7g6rwcp%2BXykXiiwxOMCTo%2BTobnFP6R692%2BVAwlbi9T2lJZPfbx77nAAXmDPUg8738SjwkGAJ%2BSopcJFTQR8Vj8zftmBYnwB596rfusPNqIMFjDaGmIH331QtDArba9trnFcxMG67jcpC90etrpj0lNTlSXEyQRgdffh14aATU1p6qKCMyrHCoxf3%2FL6117wsCTTsyzpYbpN&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20230217T035309Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYQJPGCUVU%2F20230217%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=22421b67565b081edf79ae26a843d051ae79ae018788685157644be44f2f1e2d&hash=ac1afcc7ab25ff61ec9a2bba51670f49bda9e47f5be90442c297acf967730f5b&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S0021925818638256&tid=spdf-020ae892-9b8f-4c9c-897b-13ee6d62af2c&sid=7ae36e8318120649e588d807e59f7dccdc0bgxrqa&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&ua=0f1650580f055a53510600&rr=79ab930ada828c9b&cc=us)). One of the diseases of interest is metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) caused by arylsulfatase A (ARSA)-deficiency (ARSA is a lysosomal enzyme). It has been observed that amongst patients this disease receiving ex-vivo gene therapy, having submyeloablative or myeloablative conditioning showed similar level on VCN in PBMC/ enzyme activity ([Fumagalli et al., 2022](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02017-1/fulltext)), further demonstrate the need to investigate the minimal effective dose/ conditioning strength for ex-vivo gene therapy.

5. Further investigation on using this model for pediatric population. We've discussed this in the uncertainty part of the model. 

6. Sensitivity analysis on the parameters that influences the dynamics of immuno cells reconstitution after HSCT/ ex-vivo gene therapy.
